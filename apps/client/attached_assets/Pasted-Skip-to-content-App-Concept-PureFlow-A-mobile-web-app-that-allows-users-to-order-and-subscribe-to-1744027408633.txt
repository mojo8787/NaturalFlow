I understand you can't see the referral code. Let me add a section to display your referral code in the dashboard and make it easy to share.

I understand you used a referral code during registration but didn't see any confirmation or reward. Let me implement a feature to show both the referrer and the referred user that the referral was successful.

Enhance referral system: Add referral code application logic and display available rewards on the dashboard.
I've added a rewards section to the dashboard and improved the referral process. Can you try registering a new account with a referral code to see if you get the success message and if the referrer sees their reward?
